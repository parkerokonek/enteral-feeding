## Additional Notes and Usage

In order to get the correct feeding output please verify that the settings are all correct before adding breaks.

Please enter hours in the order that they are missed.

For any mistakes in adding hours you can use the 'Clear Hours' button. This will reset your missed hours. 

Those doing titration can add custom feeding rates. Keep in mind that custom rates may interfere with auto logged rates.

When doing custom rates make sure you double check accuracy of your feeding rates!

The resulting catch-up rate will always reflect what is on the timeline.
